It appears that the top four regions have HIV prevalence around 24% (Eswatini, Lesotho, Botswana, and Zimbabwe), and have a lead in HIV prevalence by roughly 5% in comparison to the next ranked regions. These are also close in prevalence, hovering around 13% prevalence before the last two ranked regions that are collectively about 3% lower in prevalence. When all the data is held consistent at the same timestamp of year 2024, we see a similar trend:\n\n#2024 data:\nhiv_prev24_top10 &lt;- \nhiv_prevalence_clean |&gt;\n  filter(datayear == \"2024\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(prevalence)) |&gt;\n  slice(1:10) |&gt;\n  mutate(region = fct_reorder(region, prevalence))\n\n#lollipop plot - 2024 data\nggplot(data = hiv_prev24_top10, aes(x=prevalence, y=region)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(yend = region, x=0, xend = prevalence, color = \"blue3\"), show.legend= FALSE) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Year 2024 limited data\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most notable difference between the collective data on prevalence and the data restricted to year 2024 is in the rankings for 7th through 10th. When year isn’t considered, the country that is introduced to this visualization is Zambia instead of Tanzania, taking 7th and bumping Malawi and Equatorial Guinea down a rank. The fact that there isn’t much of a shift in HIV prevalence when considering year could suggest that\n- A) more heavily HIV affected countries update their data more often, or\n- B) Regardless of the data’s time stamp, certain regions consistently have a higher prevalence of HIV."

What limits this visualization however, is the greyed out countries showing a lack of data for that region. This is either due to a mismatch in region label when joining the datasets, or a lack of data for that region. The main takeaway is that Southern African regions appear to be the most affected by HIV in their population."

    "text": "Connections to Data334\n\nLollipop plot: This is a good visualization because the line segments all start at 0, so they provide an accurate communal baseline for reader interpretation. The size and color of the lollipops has also been adjusted for aesthetic pleasure. To distinguish between the 2 datasets used, a title above the plot is also utilized, so its easier for the reader to orient themselves.\n\nSequential map: This is a good visualization as the colors are color blind friendly, and there is no background grid or fluff to disorient the viewer. A label at the top clarifies what data is being used, and the color scale is sequential since it best represents the prevalence percentage scale (opposed to diverging or catagorical). One spot of critique would be limiting the greyed out countries, but that is already addressed. A map such as this is also a good visualization for this data, since it allows the reader to further pull ideas about geological hotspots of HIV for the globe, an inference that you couldn’t as confidently make out in just the lollipop plot."

While it doesn’t contain temporal information, the most recent data update is noted to be 2023. (Exact month/day unknown). The data set contains 8 columns and 231 observations, with notable variables as listed below.\n\nCovid-19, aka Coronavirus, is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people infected experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without treatment, but severe cases require medical attention. The elderly or those with underlying medical conditions are more likely to develop severe cases of Covid-19, however it is possible for anyone at any age or health status to develop a severe case.\nKnown to many, Covid-19 was the pathogenic agent in the Global pandemic of 2020. The notoriety of the disease came from how contageous it came to be, and the number of lives it took. The pandemic globally impacted daily life, economic status, and health status of all countries, and brought to light the roles and dynamics of Public Health measures.\n\nThis blog seeks to visualize various aspects of Covid-19’s impact in 2023, focusing on the death counts, population, number of tests taken in the country, and number of cases in reach country/region.\n\n\n\n\nMy first impulse was to visualize the mortality in comparison to the number of cases each country had. As there are many countries in the data set, I’ve limited this to the top 10 countries with the highest number of deaths.\n\n#data for top deaths\ncovid_top10deaths &lt;- covid_worldwide |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(deaths)) |&gt;\n  slice(1:10) |&gt;\n  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, desc(deaths))) |&gt;\n  mutate(deathcases_prop = (deaths / tot_cases)*100 ) |&gt; #calculate mortality Rate\n  mutate(deathcases_prop =  round(deathcases_prop, 2))\n\n# data for labeling what % of total cases the death makes up for\ncovid_top10deaths_labs &lt;- covid_top10deaths |&gt;\n  select(country, deathcases_prop, deaths)\n  \n\nggplot(data = covid_top10deaths, aes(x=country, y=deaths, fill = deathcases_prop)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(data= covid_top10deaths_labs, aes(label = deathcases_prop), nudge_y = 25000) +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Countries With the Largest Covid-19 Death Count\",\n       caption = \"Black numbers represent the % of total Covid-19 cases that led to death.\",\n       x = \"Mortality Rate (%)\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph, we first see the top 10 countries that had the highest counts of death from Covid-19. Also visualized is the mortality rate (% of total Covid-19 cases that led to death), also visualized in color, to better capture the impact of the disease in each country. As an example interpretation, we see that Brazil has roughly 700,000 deaths from Covid-19, and that 1.89% of their total covid cases led to death; a mortality rate of roughly 2 deaths per 100 Covid cases. &lt;\n\nWhile the USA has the most deaths from Covid, which suggests that Covid-19 impacted the US the most, we also need to take into account the mortality rate to consider deaths in comparison to total Covid cases. Taking the mortality rate into consideration, we now see that Peru, highlighted in yellow with a reported mortality rate of 4.89%, seems to have been hit the hardest by Covid-19 on this graph. It brings to light how the ratio of deaths to instances of disease plays a larger role in determining disease impact on a country’s population.

Here, we see that Yemen, Sudan, and Syria suffered the most casualties from those who contracted Covid-19, while the leaders earlier like Britain, the US, and Brazil don’t even make the leaderboard here. This suggests that healthcare systems may have struggled to support those who fell ill, since a greater proportion of those who contracted Covid-19 in these countries passed away.\n\nBut what of the population as a whole?

For the most part, I don’t think it greatly affected the data visualization, as countries with missing or suspiciously low counts may have unreliable Covid reporting systems in place to represent their population accurately. (There could be other reasons for odd counts or NAs however, this assumption could be biased base on my currently limited knowledge on the strength of healthcare and public health systems in place globally.)"

    "text": "Connection to Classwork\nTouching on Data 234 coursework, I utilized labels to add more context to my deaths count and mortality bar graph, as well as selected a colorblind friendly color pallet from viridis. The scale_fill_viridis_c() option was chosen, as the _c() relates to a continuous color scale, which I felt suited the data better than a binned color scale would (_b() option). The utilization of geom_bar() with a stat = “identity” application also references the use of statistical transformations in our Grammar of Graphics coursework. The lollipop plot with Mexico highlighted is also from coursework, displaying how you can use manual commands to further customize a graph."
